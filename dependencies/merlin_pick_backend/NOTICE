Attibution to https://github.com/aevyrie, over at https://github.com/aevyrie/bevy_mod_picking/tree/f1b6997f74d6e3b7bc4c58a59e5057a113fccbdd/backends/bevy_picking_sprite

Main changes are:
    - Made it work with a pixel camera and zoom configurations
    - Fixed some of the sprite blocking issues with small fixes / work arounds
    - Added a very similar backend for sprites from a sprite atlas
    - Maybe some other stuff i have forgotten

Many thanks to aevyrie for the great work they do on the orginal bevy_mod_picking. Can't wait for future development with bevy's ecosystem and the merge of bevy_mod_picking beta into main!
